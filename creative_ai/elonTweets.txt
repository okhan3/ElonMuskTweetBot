@teslaownersSV We‚Äôll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won‚Äôt do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
@Kristennetten Your Twitter comments are great btw!

@Kristennetten This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they‚Äôd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs
@Real_John_D @Teslarati @tesla_raj There will be no loss of either
@flcnhvy @Teslarati @tesla_raj That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi
@JoeWBowles @BillGates He‚Äôs def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6

@TeslaForLife @Tesla @RamTrucks @Ford Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated

@Erdayastronaut Really? Ok sure.

‚öîÔ∏è Study the Blade!! ‚öîÔ∏è https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI
@annerajb @flcnhvy We‚Äôre creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can‚Äôt be made using standard methods.
@flcnhvy Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press

@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called ‚ÄúPitch Day‚Äù &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don‚Äôt buy APCs. It‚Äôs the Air Force.
@WillFealey @Teslarati Fair point. Coming soon. We‚Äôre making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
@flcnhvy Great poem

@NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
@TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer
@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq

@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq

@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren‚Äôt aware that orbit (and ‚Äúzero‚Äù gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
@NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly ‚Ä¶

@wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
@brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ‚Ä¶
@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above ~30 deg latitude.

@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor ‚Äî far more than in design of the engine itself!
@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE There‚Äôs so much power going through this engine that it‚Äôs close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
@Carter__99 @Erdayastronaut @askingbubble385 @Cor_SPACE Yes
@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE No, we‚Äôve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we‚Äôll get around to it, but not needed for flight.
@NCBirbhan @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Probably around 6 or 7pm

@annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don‚Äôt stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.

@The_ShadowZone @DJSnM For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating

@happych19952208 üòâ
@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I‚Äôm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg.
@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3
@SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.

@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed
@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.

@nate_mccomb @Teslarati 48 61 20 68 61
@Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
@Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you‚Äôre prob ok.
@Erdayastronaut @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric ü§£ü§£
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there‚Äôs no weather in space
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It‚Äôs such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that‚Äôs not indicative of capability.
@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult

@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system‚Äôs fusion reactor (the sun).
@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand

@NASA @NASAJuno We are tiny
@JaneidyEve @justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @SpaceX Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with 3 Raptors almost ready to fly by then.
@SIMOZT1 @justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @SpaceX I would‚Äôve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
@justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @SpaceX Relief
@Sofiaan @Lindowitz @Tesla Ok, will discuss with team
@Lindowitz @Tesla Sure
@Tesla Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute
@justpaulinelol @EvaFoxU @SpaceX August 24th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica
@EvaFoxU @SpaceX That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died.

@TeslaClubIN @Yashwanthnadal For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
@hi__hassan Not sure. Will check with my team.
@Yashwanthnadal I‚Äôm told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
@SciGuySpace Orbital refilling is vital to humanity‚Äôs future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.

@justpaulinelol @schristakos @jgrano305 @DMC_Ryan Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August

@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren‚Äôt hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

@hypercharts @ElonsWorld @Tesla No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot
@hypercharts @ElonsWorld @Tesla Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you‚Äôd expect.
@FredericLambert @Warhly Maybe end of next year

@ThisIsJonathanR @Its1754 @krkaiser @ropiko Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP
‚ÄúIf you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.‚Äù ‚Äî Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
@JeanLikeDenim Probably
@ropiko Agreed. That‚Äôs approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them &amp; we won‚Äôt be able to.
@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week

@DisruptResearch @flcnhvy @lexfridman @Tesla To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car

@NebraskaJR @Ninja Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines

@cleantechnica 2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
@bitbased @Antsmash @joseph_preece @Erdayastronaut @SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates That‚Äôs actually kinda true
@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.
@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent.
@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low
@C3LT_Games @SciGuySpace There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
@Cocalarix @romaarra Probably sooner
@romaarra Ok
@TherrinKSCVC @SteelSully @annerajb @kickber @ExploreSpaceKSC Sure, that would be an honor
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @MattLBates Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

@MattLBates @Erdayastronaut I know ‚Ä¶ sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
@SptlightVids @SpaceX Yes, but we couldn‚Äôt take a chance on 2nd stage failing it‚Äôs 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I‚Äôm aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
@SpaceXUpdates @Erdayastronaut High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
@Erdayastronaut Center core RUD. It was a long shot.

@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
@engadget So cool
@soswow @elontimes Anything with high contrast
@teslaownersSV @elontimes Excessive shades of grey
@elontimes Yeah, we‚Äôve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
@28delayslater @EvaFoxU Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
@EvaFoxU Haha
@joe_mckirdy @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Depends on destination
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.
