It really does.
They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It‚Äôs pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‚Äò93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
Couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that‚Äôs me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.
Maybe on Starship? It‚Äôs def got the payload capacity ‚Ä¶.
Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
Yeah, it‚Äôs one of my favorite T-shirts!
We‚Äôll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won‚Äôt do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
Your Twitter comments are great btw!
Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It‚Äôs better because of you! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è.
This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they‚Äôd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs.
There will be no loss of either.
That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width.
True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi.
He‚Äôs def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6.
Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels! https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE https://t.co/Sv4JHaXcOx.
Huge admiration &amp; respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent &amp; drive is amazing!
For sure.
If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive.
Launching third flight of this Dragon spacecraft to tomorrow https://t.co/mTQ2DrWS97.
Yes.
After a while, hydrogen became sentient.
Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal.

People often think they‚Äôre breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.).
Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement.
Still can‚Äôt believe how hard it was to get https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr!
We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes.
Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!
It‚Äôs artificial.
Do you like our owl? https://t.co/4fNOEv3N5b.
Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges &amp; guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture.
Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated.
That‚Äôs why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control.
Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel.
They are dead to me.
It‚Äôs a generational thing.
With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details. https://t.co/IMLJbsInmq.
Touch√©.
Just because he has a flamethrower and I have a flamethrower doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Ä¶ um ‚Ä¶ ok fine I‚Äôm Hank Scorpio.
This one is deep. Happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/2Dog5HBxjX.
The finest in apocalypse protection technology! Flamethrower optional.
ü§£ü§£.
Def not dainty.
Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls ü§£ü§£.
250k.
We‚Äôd be happy to help.
Sure, will aim to do this next week.
Agreed, this will be exciting to see!
Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.
Bring it on https://t.co/pCnln1NdRO.
Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!

Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn‚Äôt bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time ‚Ä¶.
Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill https://t.co/OfaqUkrDI3.
Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesn‚Äôt cost crazy money for ~3mm skins.
In general, this is something Tesla should do.
We should def make it good to hang out there.
Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year.
Good question. It‚Äôs a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.
Can be wrapped in any color!
The body panels will actually be laser cut!
Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too.
Interesting idea.
True.
ü§£ü§£.
Really? Ok sure.
Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level.
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I‚Äôm confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
‚öîÔ∏è Study the Blade!! ‚öîÔ∏è https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI.
We‚Äôre creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can‚Äôt be made using standard methods.
Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made.
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press.
Excellent review by Marques! https://t.co/RaXLl30FfF.
187k.
Yes.
Haha v true.
With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement.
146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor.
Great analysis.
That would be cool.
Gonna have some sick attachments.
