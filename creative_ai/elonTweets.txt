That‚Äôs the one!
It really does.
They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It‚Äôs pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‚Äò93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
Couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that‚Äôs me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.
Maybe on Starship? It‚Äôs def got the payload capacity ‚Ä¶.
Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
Yeah, it‚Äôs one of my favorite T-shirts!
We‚Äôll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won‚Äôt do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
Your Twitter comments are great btw!
Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It‚Äôs better because of you! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è.
This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they‚Äôd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs.
There will be no loss of either.
That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width.
True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi.
He‚Äôs def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6.

People often think they‚Äôre breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.).
Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement.

Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges &amp; guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture.
Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated.
That‚Äôs why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control.
Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel.
They are dead to me.
It‚Äôs a generational thing.
With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details. https://t.co/IMLJbsInmq.

Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year.
Good question. It‚Äôs a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.
Can be wrapped in any color!
The body panels will actually be laser cut!
Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too.
Interesting idea.
True.
ü§£ü§£.
Really? Ok sure.
Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level.
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I‚Äôm confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
‚öîÔ∏è Study the Blade!! ‚öîÔ∏è https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI.
We‚Äôre creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can‚Äôt be made using standard methods.
Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made.
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press.
Excellent review by Marques! https://t.co/RaXLl30FfF.

Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
Pretty much.
Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?
So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable.
As the planets align only once every two years.
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city.
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half.
If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year.
Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year.
The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
Gas/diesel cars too.
True.

Naturally.
This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called ‚ÄúPitch Day‚Äù &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don‚Äôt buy APCs. It‚Äôs the Air Force.
Fair point. Coming soon. We‚Äôre making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
More to come.
Yes.
Would be odd to expect anything else.
That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth.
Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
Great poem.
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we‚Äôve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. https://t.co/Q814zVoW4S.

Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong.
Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there‚Äôs a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.

Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended.
We‚Äôre changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc.
Very true. Glass doesn‚Äôt burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
I hate advertising.
Unfortunately, it‚Äôs hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don‚Äôt make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot.
If you‚Äôre directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today.
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires.
So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. https://t.co/3y4M5L50qF.

Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth.
To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9.

Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I‚Äôm in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It‚Äôs insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you ‚Ä¶.
Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I‚Äôve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard.
And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020.
Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines.
Conservation of energy tells you the answer.
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table.
Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq.
This is true. All that matters is number used in ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU.
Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
We‚Äôre working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren‚Äôt actual parking spaces.
Yeah, great team!
To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq.
Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
Most people aren‚Äôt aware that orbit (and ‚Äúzero‚Äù gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly ‚Ä¶.

Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts.
Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ‚Ä¶.
Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid.
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
üòâ.
Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.

All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We‚Äôre focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts.
For what it‚Äôs worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I‚Äôve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon &amp; Dragon at the Cape &amp; all testing done in ~10 weeks.

Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest it‚Äôs ever been &amp; doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them.
If 20km works, then orbit.
Great summary of the key points!
That‚Äôs about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced.
It‚Äôs all the ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe.
Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton.

Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.
Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see.
Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back.
Haha yes.
In solving for a good Mars climate, we will learn a great deal about how to do so on Earth. It is the inverse problem.

Summon is improving rapidly https://t.co/khgXDRnD2Z.
Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor ‚Äî far more than in design of the engine itself!
There‚Äôs so much power going through this engine that it‚Äôs close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places.
Yes.
Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
No, we‚Äôve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we‚Äôll get around to it, but not needed for flight.
Probably around 6 or 7pm.
What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber &amp; nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12,000 psi.
Figure of speech.
Meanwhile, back in reality https://t.co/NrHHB9G81L.
Media report was false.
Raptor uses milled copper channels with an inconel jacket all the way down.

Wow, it‚Äôs been 5 years since we started at Boca!
About a week. Will include slight improvements, based on initial user feedback.
We look for rare corner case issues with a limited release US build, then expand internationally as we receive approval from regulatory authorities. So, soon, but hard to say exactly.

That would be a nice touch.
This is quite a complex beast, but hopefully within a month or so.
Haha awesome.
We could probably do that.
50m.
Not sure we could go quite that tight, but we can for sure allow much narrower spaces at user‚Äôs discretion.
With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don‚Äôt stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.
Mk1 ship is around 200 tons dry &amp; 1400 tons wet, but aiming for 120 by Mk4 or Mk5. Total stack mass with max payload is 5000 tons.

It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
This includes original engineering of new factory processes &amp; cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization.
Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory &amp; car.
For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust.
Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating.
Many powerful electric motors &amp; batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
That‚Äôs correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.

Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca https://t.co/Bqt40mSdX4.
Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 &amp; a skydiver.
üòâ.
Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
Current analysis, which I‚Äôm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2.
Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg.
Stability is not an issue with 3.
Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
Yes. There‚Äôs a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven‚Äôt closed it out.

No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
It‚Äôs a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.

Wise words from Gary the Bot.
However, we won‚Äôt customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla &amp; customer legal bill to be high &amp; drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at https://t.co/sCkn87vMa9. https://t.co/V1rNPM1Hdk.
Exactly! We‚Äôve only one car factory in California &amp; one Gigafactory (for batteries &amp; drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it.
At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
Agreed.
Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
Hopefully, next year.

Looks good.
The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won‚Äôt fall off due to vibration &amp; acoustics.
48 61 20 68 61.
The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
Precisely.
Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you‚Äôre prob ok.
ü§£ü§£.
You know destination weather before departure &amp; there‚Äôs no weather in space.
Everything happens so fast. It‚Äôs such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that‚Äôs not indicative of capability.
Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult.
Most likely.

True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September.
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand.
Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming.
ü§£ü§£.
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites üõ∞ to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd).
AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It‚Äôs mostly design-review based, not flight-based.
Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters.

Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B.
Powerwall doesn‚Äôt need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla &amp; non-Tesla solar panels.

But actual road data is what matters most https://t.co/q44lsjJZZa.
Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff ‚Ä¶.

For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
Not sure. Will check with my team.
I‚Äôm told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
Orbital refilling is vital to humanity‚Äôs future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.

Haha probably true (sigh).
Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August.
Tesla Service Centers &amp; a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year.
Will recognize &amp; read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights &amp; stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
Hoping to get ‚ÄúJoe Mode‚Äù into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting ‚ÄúJoe Mode‚Äù would lower the volume of strident beeps &amp; chimes by half.
If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release.
Yes.
Some.
Not currently in V10, but will try.
Yes, V10 will include several games &amp; infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light &amp; stop sign recognition &amp; Smart Summon.
Can‚Äôt you just play though phone Bluetooth?
We‚Äôre close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months.
Maybe August, not more than a few months.
Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound.
When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving.
Ability to stream YouTube &amp; Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats &amp; surround sound audio.

Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option.
Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2.
High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren‚Äôt hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot.

Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP.
‚ÄúIf you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.‚Äù ‚Äî Gen Shinseki.
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
Probably.
Agreed. That‚Äôs approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16.
Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them &amp; we won‚Äôt be able to.
No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers.
If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week.

Take note.
About right, but dangerously chuggy &amp; risking bad things at 40%. We‚Äôll keep it above 50% for this flight.
More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin Œ∏/2, as I recall, but doesn‚Äôt matter, as there‚Äôs no geo üõ∞ anywhere near that mass.
3.
100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
Cont of main.
We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.

To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car.
Between first development engine &amp; first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware &amp; software. Over time, thousands.
Upgrading to 250kW soon.
Intersections with complex traffic lights &amp; shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
Local supporters will be invited!
Yes.
~Q4 2016.
End of Q4, most likely.
Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won‚Äôt diverge until Q4, as it‚Äôs limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
This is why it‚Äôs possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k &amp; make at least ~500k FSD cars.
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer &amp; all production in past few months has FSD computer.

Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident &amp; do our best to minimize probability of recurrence.

FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less &amp; convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines.
Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.

We poured our heart &amp; soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Faberg√© egg of cars.
Hardly anyone noticed, but still.
We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
Design &amp; production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible https://t.co/IkBliEcSae.
2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option.
That‚Äôs actually kinda true.
Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.
That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent.
~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low.
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
Probably sooner.
Ok.
Sure, that would be an honor.
Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
High entry force &amp; heat breached engine bay &amp; center engine TVC failed.
Ok, thanks.
:(.
Working on Tesla global logistics.
I know ‚Ä¶ sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
Yes, but we couldn‚Äôt take a chance on 2nd stage failing it‚Äôs 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I‚Äôm aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
He was the real deal.
One of our main conference rooms at SpaceX is named after Goddard.

üñ§ Tesla Software Engineering üñ§.
Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK.
All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó.
It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more.
Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
So cool.
Anything with high contrast.
Excessive shades of grey.
Yeah, we‚Äôve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week.
Haha.
Depends on destination.
Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level.
Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
Chomsky sucks.
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn.
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven.
Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

China EV subsidies mostly end this month &amp; fully end in about 7 months.
Yes.
No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. It‚Äôs great to get thoughtful criticism.
155mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only 5 offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to 31mph.
Tesla Superchargers &amp; service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year.
Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings.
Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That‚Äôs 57,600/hour/lane &amp; you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput &amp; convenience.
Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.

Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further.
Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto &amp; oil companies aren‚Äôt known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors &amp; space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity &amp; ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.
Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.
Wings/flaps &amp; leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn‚Äôt affect schedule much though.
Not bad.
Exactly. We‚Äôre on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
Yeah, the fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights.
I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
One day‚Äôs grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow.
Edgy move.
Good idea.
True. I‚Äôm a gamer &amp; my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
Yup.
Would love to do exactly that.
Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We‚Äôll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun.
Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers.
If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that‚Äôs easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map. https://t.co/83MwIZAEP6 https://t.co/NllMXregRg.
There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won‚Äôt be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully &amp; will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible. https://t.co/OuWYfNmw0D.
No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
Fair.
Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps &amp; elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot.
Opposite is true: you can have 100‚Äôs of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below.
Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly &amp; directly that it doesn‚Äôt matter.
Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!

Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move.
~2.8m.
Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side &amp; complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber.
Horizontally.
First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
So it goes.
3 months.
Hopefully, 4 months.
Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees.
https://t.co/ViY0WgtfOZ.
Sure.
Two tunnels about a mile long each.
Yes.
Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you‚Äôd have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth.
N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.

Yeah, there was a major change in last several months. Everyone noticed, Fred. Hello.
Will do.
Absolutely.
Seriously.
Also, how did you manage to get shamed into being de facto anti-Tesla by social media trolls. Jeez ‚Ä¶.
Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV‚Äôs have high fire risk when opposite is true.
Thanks, support super appreciated.
Sad if true üòî.
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bT2ZbnN8Yd.
Anti-matter def wins on energy density ü§£ü§£.
Exactly. By end of this quarter, about half a million Teslas will have full self-driving hardware (pending computer swap) &amp; we will make another half million FSD cars by mid next year.
As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost &amp; larger range pack needed.
Over a quarter million gasoline vehicle fires per year in USA alone https://t.co/xoaK6v6T6f.

I‚Äôve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy.
Good point, small oil is a problem too.
I‚Äôm sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can‚Äôt *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos√© pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they‚Äôre all angels ‚Ä¶.
Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
True, Bloomberg is almost as bad.
Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock üß¶ puppets of big oil.
Starship is kinda Gundam.
Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that‚Äôs a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn‚Äôt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.

Mr Buffett, please stop destroying Dairy Queen. In the name of all that is holy, please stop.
Wow, a lot of people don‚Äôt know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
There is 35 GWh/yr ‚Äútheoretical capacity‚Äù, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3‚Äôs in Q1 due to cell constraints.
Yes.
Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date.
Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn‚Äôt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability.
Yes.
There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase.
Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.
Tesla will start FSD computer upgrade in a few months.
Something like that.
Starting May 1.
Please note that the price of the Tesla Full Self-Driving option will increase substantially over time.
Coming this year.
Lease a Tesla online in a few mins &amp; have it delivered to your house (return within 7 days for full refund) https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr.
Cryptocurrency is my safe word.
Model 3 drive unit &amp; body is designed like a commercial truck for a million mile life. Current battery modules should last 300k to 500k miles (1500 cycles). Replacing modules (not pack) will only cost $5k to $7k.
Cool.

That would be cool to do one day.
Other automakers change prices constantly &amp; substantially by varying rebates &amp; discounts according to negotiating strength of buyer. Tesla is transparent &amp; consistent.
So if we raise prices in the future, will you cut Tesla a check? Can‚Äôt have it both ways.

Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
Impressive analysis.
Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we‚Äôll add a setting to disable internal camera.
Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows &amp; rear window.
It‚Äôs there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft &amp; people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video.

No, but for sure the other way around!
Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can‚Äôt hear, but you can feel in your chest.
We‚Äôre going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
Annoying that perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can‚Äôt. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that‚Äôs very rare.
Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.
Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what‚Äôs there. Not impossible.
Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
Anyone who bought FSD will get it.
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward ‚ÄúHW3‚Äù will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. https://t.co/lICMpT7xnX.
Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.
Massive delta velocity slam from highly elliptical Earth orbit using a fully retanked, but lightened up Starship with no heat shield or fins/legs. Best choice for the impatient. Ion engines are too slow.
We should send probes to outer solar system &amp; get high res, true color images of these strange things. Maybe there‚Äôs an alien artifact out there ‚Ä¶.

I think so. For sure worth giving it our best shot! Would be great to have a competitive, commercial program to build a moon base that is outcome-oriented (not cost-plus), so you only get paid for safe delivery of cargo.

Hard to appreciate how much Tesla Autopilot improves enjoyment of driving until you try it https://t.co/Giqb2WLVAb.
Yes, otherwise propellant usage for an atmospheric entry would be very high and/or center of mass would need to be very tightly constrained. Yes, but we‚Äôre going to skip that at first to avoid fragging launch pads.

White-hot parts reached orbital entry temp of around 1650 Kelvin.
Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.
Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing. Zero refurbishment.
No straight path for hot gas to accelerate through the gaps.

We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don‚Äôt need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
Agreed.
Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout ‚Ä¶.
Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.

This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production.
Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer.
Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity.
Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.

In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak.
We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
Yes.
Those prices will revert to normal on Monday too.

Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time.
We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. https://t.co/h2MMBjkzLu.

Extremely important merch https://t.co/3ZUin7kzYk.
Net power to warm pack is especially low when motors are running, as coolant loop routes motor heat to the pack when outside is cold (&amp; rejects motor heat to air when outside is warm).
Yes, but an engine shouldn‚Äôt count until it flies.
Ukraine did play a major role.
Very little power &amp; only right before you get to the Supercharger. You won‚Äôt notice it in range.
If you navigate to Supercharger, car will warm up battery en route, so you start immediately at max power.

Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It‚Äôs 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder.
Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel.
Yes, exciting potential.

Guys, I have feelings ‚Ä¶ üòú.
Focusing on Starship instead.
Deorbits &amp; burns up over the Pacific.
Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads &amp; Dragon abort thrusters.
Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so.
Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That‚Äôs scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big.
High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life.
Crew Dragon high altitude abort test.
Yes üòÄ.
Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April. https://t.co/uq6TdMhgFN.
Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight.
SN2 has changes that should help.
To the first part. I doubt we‚Äôd create a Dyson ring or sphere.
Yes.
Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done.
Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun.
Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space.
You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos.
Pinter injector tends to have hot &amp; cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars.
We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done.
Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage.
That‚Äôs true üòÄ Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there.
Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
Don‚Äôt know.
SpaceX commercial üöÄ launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd.
Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.
So true ü§° John Clarke üëå.
Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure &amp; temperature in oxygen preburner.

Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.
Yes.
This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9.
Close.
But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners.
About 11 secs.
Definitely! It‚Äôs amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by engine/test team! https://t.co/yPrvO0JhyY.

Joe Rogan describes Tesla for 4 mins &amp; 20 secs https://t.co/ju6N683Dd5.
Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry.
Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads.
Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just ‚ÄúStarship‚Äù &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy.

We‚Äôll tweak the alloy over time, so it won‚Äôt exactly be 301, but close.
Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart.
Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn‚Äôt even need paint!
Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
Mostly true.
Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
Yes.
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at Texas https://t.co/8JCOi1BG6z.
Yes. It‚Äôs very rare to find all three.
To be clear, I‚Äôm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding.
Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9.
Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack.
Absolutely. You‚Äôve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

Actual tanks are fine.
~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp.
Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.
Since it‚Äôs part of safety &amp; security, all cars with AP2+ hardware will get it.
Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot https://t.co/x2buQWiABX.
Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water.

Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings.
How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX.
The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication.
The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter! If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options: https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA.
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M.

Thanks!
It‚Äôs embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant.
You def don‚Äôt want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That‚Äôs not a typo.

This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
We‚Äôre building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there.
Exactly.
For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
Yes.
I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we‚Äôre building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April.
Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!
While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design.
Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference.
