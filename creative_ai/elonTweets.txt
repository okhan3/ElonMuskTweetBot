We don‚Äôt make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot
If you‚Äôre directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires

Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1

Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bT2ZbnN8Yd
