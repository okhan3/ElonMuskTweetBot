That’s the one!
It really does
They smashed the window to steal the radio, which was worth maybe $20. Got a replacement from junkyard. Btw, great deals available from junkyards! It’s pretty fun fixing/upgrading cars.
Yeah, 1978 320i that I bought in ‘93 for $1400. I hotrodded it by jamming in a 5 speed transmission from a later model I found in a Philly junkyard when the 4 speed transmission failed.
Couldn’t afford to pay for repairs, so I fixed almost everything on that car from parts in the junkyard. Ironically, that’s me replacing broken side window glass. The circle is complete lol.
Maybe on Starship? It’s def got the payload capacity …
Just wish Russ Mitchell would improve the *quality* of his fiction. Is this too much to ask!?
Yeah, it’s one of my favorite T-shirts!
We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck and almost died on one when I was 17.
Your Twitter comments are great btw!
Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It’s better because of you! ♥️♥️♥️
This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs
There will be no loss of either
That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
We can prob reduce width by an inch and maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything
He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs
Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great and costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels!
Huge admiration and respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent and drive is amazing!
For sure
If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive

After a while, hydrogen became sentient
Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal.
🔥🔥
People often think they’re breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O and a dash of neon and krypton (etc.)
Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement
Still can’t believe how hard it was to get
We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us and then he said yes
Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!
It’s artificial
Do you like our owl?
Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges and guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture.
Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated
That’s why Cybertruck has active suspension height and damping control
Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng and active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look and feel.
They are dead to me
It’s a generational thing
With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details.
Touché
Just because he has a flamethrower and I have a flamethrower doesn’t mean … um … ok fine I’m Hank Scorpio

Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls 🤣🤣
250k
We’d be happy to help
Sure, will aim to do this next week
Agreed, this will be exciting to see!
Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.
Bring it on
Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
200k
Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time …
Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill
Higher hardness, higher strength and doesn’t cost crazy money for ~3mm skins
In general, this is something Tesla should do
We should def make it good to hang out there
Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year
Good question. It’s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.
Can be wrapped in any color!
The body panels will actually be laser cut!
Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too
Interesting idea
True
🤣🤣
Really? Ok sure.
Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity and lower part count.
⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️
We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods.
Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press
Excellent review by Marques!
187k
Yes
Haha v true

We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event and didn’t even scratch the glass!
Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911. Order Cybertruck online at
Yes
Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30.
Tesla 2 person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck
See ya in 2077 😉

Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different.
Maybe won’t need a key at all
So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence …

Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle and no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
Pretty much
Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting and inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous and difficult than Earth and take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?
So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
As the planets align only once every two years
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles and each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars
Gas/diesel cars too
True
Extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy)
Of course!
Yes
The date is strangely familiar …
Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory
Looking into it
Yes
The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF
Naturally
This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” and I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
More to come
Yes
Would be odd to expect anything else
That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days and requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours and ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
Great poem
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team and Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row.
Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!
Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃 Happy Halloween!!
Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong
Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 and 1/4 mile races.
Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar!
Congrats! Shopify is great btw. Nice work.
The fires are all too real
Haha true

Hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess
Soon, SpaceX will launch astronauts to
That’s significantly improved in current production
True, my name literally means tree
If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you’re home and to home if at work. Not sure if that’s in wide release yet, but def in early access. It’s an awesome feature.

Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted and what kind of trees?
Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended
We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc
Very true. Glass doesn’t burn and melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
I hate advertising
Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads and SEO. Go to to add solar to an existing roof and for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot
If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires
So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas and being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important.
I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs
Extremely high
Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters
US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time

Tesla Solarglass roof
Will start at ~2:15. Sorry for slight delay.
Haha true
Srsly
Transparent aluminum is a real thing!
That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!
Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!
Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly.
🔥
Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth.
To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended
California time
This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right
Will do an open call Q&amp;A
Major FUD incoming for sure … haha

Super proud of Tesla team for great execution and support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!
Tesla Q3 results: - Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule - Model Y ahead of schedule - Solar installs +48% from Q2 - GAAP profitable - Positive free cash flow
The big rear wing is only on for one day for rear downforce calibration. Isn’t needed to set ring record and won’t be in the production car.
Internal camera isn’t used yet (meant for robotaxi), but that’s a good idea
Please lmk about your experience and what can be improved
Coming soon
Whoa, it worked!!

Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow
More carrot, less stick
Very likely that a home with clean power that’s lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value
PG&amp;E says rolling blackouts expected in California for next 10 years!
Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power and no blackouts!
Going offline for a few days
Both at the same time!
More about dealing with failure modes and roll control
Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well.
Common myth, but incorrect
And so begins the robocalypse …
Tesla wins best headlights award 🥇
The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track
Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing and building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …
Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard
And the lead character is also named Woody
Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place and only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room and moment of inertia is much lower.
Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table
Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.
This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.
Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen and oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces.
Yeah, great team!
To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth.
Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear and drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …
Software
Yes
Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon
Venus would be very difficult

Yes, we will
It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when and how fast to move the wipers.

Yep, good catch

Depends on total system efficiency and how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess
Whoa, that does look good!
Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
French fries 🍟 are the devil 😈
.@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?
Super messed up situation!
Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …
Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many and much better than driving a single car.
Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
😉
Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.
Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive.
Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1
Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power and no more blackouts!

All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up and received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts.
For what it’s worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I’ve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon and Dragon at the Cape and all testing done in ~10 weeks

Thanks, Tesla team is the strongest it’s ever been and doing an amazing job! Honored to work beside them.
If 20km works, then orbit
Great summary of the key points!
That’s about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot and have to be replaced.
It’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me, not engines and primary airframe
Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton
Stop sending me this 💩 🤣🤣
Agreed and such a heartwarming photo ♥️
I have that exact thought every time I get the flu
Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
Lot of ways to melt and join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently and with precise parts.
Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right and not needed with steel.
Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see
Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back
Haha yes
In solving for a good Mars climate, we will learn a great deal about how to do so on Earth. It is the inverse problem.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light
We’re going to use the pedestrian pink noise speaker to talk to people and create customized horn sounds. “I beg your pardon, but would you be so kind as to allow me to proceed?” Said in the voice of Mr. Darcy.

Summon is improving rapidly
Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing and machining of Raptor — far more than in design of the engine itself!
There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
Yes
Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints and dissimilar metals at such high pressure and temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have and we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight.
Probably around 6 or 7pm
What blows my mind is that peak pressure in regen chamber and nozzle is *far* above combustion pressure at over 800 bar or ~12,000 psi
Figure of speech
Meanwhile, back in reality

With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don’t stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.

Impressive work by Chad and Steve!
Almost entirely C++, but we did have an (advanced for the time) client-side Java app for viewing maps and (weirdly) a 3D hockey game in VRML
Turbo Pascal
Mostly C/C++, Python and SQL
It would be pretty embarrassing to use a non-Tesla battery!
This includes original engineering of new factory processes and cars. Great engineers will only join if original engineering is supported, not just localization.
Tesla is building a major engineering team in China, incl heavy focus on software/firmware for factory and car
For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling and quite robust
Better just to ride your max temp all the way down and let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating
Many powerful electric motors and batteries. Force required is enormous, as entire fin moves. More about this on the 28th.
That’s correct. Essentially controlled falling, like a skydiver.
Herbert Diess is doing more than any big carmaker to go electric. The good of the world should come first. For what it’s worth, he has my support.

“Between the trees and the forest floor, it’s like a giant mural,” continued the veritable High Priest of the Harvest Season, adding that he would soon have to rake his driveway, an activity for which he will most certainly don a cashmere scarf.
Hoping to open in Slovakia, Croatia, Serbia and most of Eastern Europe early next year. Finally, we will do Nikola Tesla proud by having his cars in his countries of origin!
OG Roadster is def helping us out here with 826M miles by itself

Classified as a URO, unidentified road object (from Area 69)
SpaceX Foundry is used exclusively for advanced alloys/shapes for Raptor, incl our superalloy, SX500
Bottom half of Starship at night. Top half with forward fins and header tanks probably stacks on Wednesday. Three Raptors already installed.
Raceway and flap hinge aero covers
Just leaving SpaceX Starship build site in Boca
Super Heavy rocket will be much like Falcon 9, but the Ship is a strange combination of Dragon, F9 and a skydiver.
😉
Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle and ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass and pressure.
Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear and fwd fins during entry and landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg.
Stability is not an issue with 3
Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors and rear fins at the bottom.
Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out.
Adding the rear moving fins to Starship Mk1 in Boca Chica, Texas
Thanks!
Either way, sustainable energy wins!!
srsly
It’s my 🔥 glasses 😉
Sure. Have to do it on Mars from beginning. Will ultimately do that on Earth too, so rocket flights will be zero net carbon long-term.
Next quarter
Will discuss with my product team next week, but probably
Yes
Great work by SpaceX parachute engineering! The Crew Dragon parachutes are way more difficult than they may seem. The Apollo program found them to be so hard that it became a notable morale problem!

Actually, Model 3 would beat the Taycan on Nürburgring over multiple laps, as it has more range
No, but very close
Rear facing, but roomier. Great for family gatherings! I did a road trip across America with my five boys and Talulah in the 7 seat Model S several years ago.
Absolutely
New Roadster and X will come later
No, original 5 forward facing seats plus 2 rear-facing smaller seats. The new rear seats will accommodate larger passengers than before.
It’s a start. We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year.
Thanks, I will stop by on the 20th!
They’re available through the app, but we need to make them easier to find

Feeling Lucky (Google tribute!) or Hungry are 100% intended for max enjoyment of Tesla owner. If location has destination chargers, that’s a plus, but car should only route there if location is great. This will be hit and miss initially, but should hone towards excellent over time.

Getting close
Yes, coming soon
Oh that would be fun. Will see.
Joe Mode is the best mode
Thanks Tesla owners. You rock!! ♥️♥️
Wise words from Gary the Bot
However, we won’t customize the contract or engage in negotiations. That just causes the Tesla and customer legal bill to be high and drag things out. Pay for clean power, not lawyers! It makes way more sense.
Good analysis. You can order commercial solar in literally 30 secs if you use Apple Pay at
Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California and one Gigafactory (for batteries and drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries and drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs and improve logistics worldwide.
Should note that these product mix and logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK and Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous and possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it
At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes and logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally and should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
Agreed
Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.
Hopefully, next year

Looks good
The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration and acoustics.
48 61 20 68 61
The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
Failure rate is actually both higher and lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
Precisely
Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox and fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.
🤣🤣
You know destination weather before departure and there’s no weather in space
Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell and fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability.
Over time, 355 and 385 are possible, but very difficult
Most likely
Photoshop is amazing
Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle

Also
Without the removal fee, Tesla Solar is unequivocally a guaranteed, instant money printer, producing $300 to $1000 per year (in after tax income!)
For the remainder of September, Tesla is permanently waiving the $1500 solar removal fee requirement. Note, the ability to stop monthly payments at any time remains.
Definitely for Space Force. We need to make Starfleet real.
Very exciting to see India’s rapid progress in space! There are always setbacks, of course, but I think India is doing great overall.
Yes
Thanks for offering! Sure, that would be great.
We might be in one right now
No, probably V10.1
Merging code branches and one more QA-level release this week. Hopefully, EAP wide release week after.
Looking good. Smart summon is almost great. Drive-in theater mode, caraoke and Cuphead are awesome.
🥳
For sure on first crewed missions for exactly that reason

Still too buggy to be in wide EAP. Requires more testing. Hopefully, going to wide EAP next week.
It’s up to 🇳🇴 and 🇳🇱 as to whether they go with EU rules or rest of world. Not our choice.
Same, except where limited by EU regulations. We’re aware of extreme consumer unhappiness about this and are working with EU regulators to address.

Very soon, sorry for the delay
Aiming for 20km flight in Oct and orbit attempt shortly thereafter. Starship update will be on Sept 28th, anniversary of SpaceX reaching orbit. Starship Mk 1 will be fully assembled by that time.
Probably 2 to 3 months. We’re about to ship Raptor SN 10.
Probably 18m for next gen system
Would love to, but import duties are extremely high, even for electric vehicles
Should be. Will fix.
Also, u can order online at in 2 mins, have car delivered to ur doorstep and return for full refund

Appears to be a wiring/connector issue
Igniters need to be inspected. We will try again tomorrow same time.
Raptor uses dual redundant torch igniters. Better long-term, but more finicky in development.
About 5 mins from flight attempt
Starhopper flight currently tracking to 5pm Texas time for 150m / ~500ft hover test
Finally, VR that’s cool *and* sexy!
Oh behave u naughty planet … 😉
😢
It’s quite robust
Where are additional Superchargers most needed?
World’s first very large scale battery has worked out well
Yes, last flight for Hopper. If all goes well, it will become a vertical test stand for Raptor.
Exactly! Especially let your PUC commissioners/authorities know.
Agreed, that’s the right future
Looks like Starhopper flight may be as soon as Monday. FAA support is much appreciated!
We’re working closely with EU regulators and hope to clarify the timeline soon
Ok
Should be soon
If you’re a utility or public utilities commission, please consider using the Tesla Megapack. Better for the environment and usually lower cost than fossil fuel peaker plants!
Yes, probably within next 6 to 9 months

The Nude Scientisté
Looks like a wheel of cheese
Ok
We need to complete internal QA testing for safety, which will hopefully be done in about 4 weeks
Wow
Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes
Not risky imo and can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun).
True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids and a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins and landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth and gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming
🤣🤣
Might make sense to have thousands of solar reflector satellites 🛰 to warm Mars vs artificial suns (tbd)
AF certification required an enormous amount of work. It’s mostly design-review based, not flight-based.
Yeah, would be great to get feedback from Tesla supporters
Initially Model 3, later Y
Looking forward to seeing Giga Shanghai soon 😀 Amazing work by Tesla China team and support of authorities much appreciated!
Not yet
This is a great idea
🤣🤣
Um I ate most of it
Cookie decorating contest with kids
Converts about 5 million tons of mass to energy every second
Great name! Wouldn’t worry about this particular one, but a big rock will hit Earth eventually and we currently have no defense.
Don’t know yet, but it’s important that the whole world transition to sustainable energy, so we’ll make costs as low as possible
One click to order solar and save ~$500/year in utility bills with no long-term contract (cancel anytime)
Next year
With the new lower Tesla pricing, it’s like having a money printer on your roof if you live a state with high electricity costs. Still better to buy, but the rental option makes the economics obvious.
Tesla Solar just relaunched. Lmk what you think …
Which means a small corner of Texas (or anywhere) with solar panels could power the entire United States
1 Gigawatt per square kilometer of solar energy reaches Earth’s surface
In a few years
Yeah, legs are hydraulic pistons and abdomen is the accumulator
Generates a *lot* of energy
It is quite silly
Meaning less than a century. But this would be pretty intense.
Aspirationally, decades
The sun is an immense thermonuclear explosion fyi
Yes
Not saying it solves everything, mind you, but it’s a step in the right direction
Yeah, the trick is opening and closing the spacesuit helmet really fast

This isn’t correct. Will address.
Good conversation with head of FAA Space. Need a bit more hazard analysis and should be clear to fly soon.

When Opportunity knocks …
Passing fad. Like steam engines. They look cool in a museum.
Because our universe is actually a microverse in a miniverse. We probably just power someone’s brake lights.
Will be needed for sure. Bandwidth, no problem, latency is a challenge 🤣🤣
Just spoke with FAA, so hopefully yes
Thanks. Starship, which aspires to be fully and immediately reusable in super heavy class, is a truly 🥜🚀. Even though I’m immersed in Starship/Raptor design and build 7 days/week, it still doesn’t feel real.
Approx min payload to Mars to nearest order of magnitude, so at $100k/ton, cost would be $100B
Powerwall doesn’t need solar panels, but will work fine with both Tesla and non-Tesla solar panels
Yes
Between $100B and $10T
Amazing work over many years by SpaceX engineering/production/launch teams to get (almost) there
For sure
Yup
Might take a bit longer to get through regulatory approvals. Likely September.
Gas cars are so last-century!
Priority / early access will be automatic for all owners with FSD
We’re accelerating opening up configurator/order page for more countries. Sorry, lot on our plate!
Probably every 2 to 4 months, depending on how much progress we make
Video is amazing with the Tesla sound system. Will include Caraoke!
FSD owners will get priority in the upload queue
Thanks for reminding me. Will rectify.
Tons of fun!
Tesla software V10 is lookin real good! Releasing to early access list soon …
🤔
Pot kettle 😀
Don’t know enough about George’s company, but it sounds like he’s focused on a machine vision approach, which is the only general solution imo
Yeah, George is a little nuts, but I like him and he often has interesting things to say
No sooner than a week. Working approvals with FAA.
Wouldn’t read too much into this. Likely to be fewer F9/FH flights, but possibly an order of magnitude more than these numbers in Starship flights.
Thanks George!
We’re working with EU regulators to improve rules. Spirit of rules is correct, but exact language doesn’t quite align with spirit. Navigate on Autopilot working well in rest of world.
But actual road data is what matters most
Ultimately, however, what really matters is empirical safety. Nothing in life is 100% safe, so optimal figure of merit is how many millions of miles/km per accident.
Good question. NHTSA is great for fundamental structural safety, except for unbelted front passenger occupant factor. Very rare these days for front passenger to be unbelted. NCAP also great, but there are some weird headlight angle factors. Super inside baseball stuff …
Well said!

Details coming at Starship update
Not in current plans, but that may change
No
Vandenberg is great for polar orbits. Will still play an important role long-term, but 80%+ will be eastward.
Great progress by Starship Cape team. Started several months behind, but catching up fast. This will be a super fun race to orbit, moon and Mars!
So much drama and good times too! Maybe worth a book one day, but would come at expense of 🚀 and 🚘 and 🧠.

Very convincing! Ok, Boca it is. We should have Starship Mk1 with 3 Raptors almost ready to fly by then.
I would’ve been bankrupt too. Unlikely investors would have funded a second attempt.
Relief
Ok, will discuss with team
Sure
Also, you can request any service from the Tesla phone app in under a minute
August 24th, either at Cape Canaveral or Boca Chica
That was our last chance to reach orbit. If it had failed, SpaceX would have died.
Yes
Will also be launching The Boring Company China on this trip
Good idea
You’re most welcome!
Fates loves irony
For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
Not sure. Will check with my team.
I’m told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
Orbital refilling is vital to humanity’s future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.
Fixing …
Depot haha
Mailing Dragon dock with Space Station is much harder than docking with our own ship for refilling. Not a problem.
Never thought we’d make it this far

We’re working on it. Agreed, Minecraft is high priority. Roblox too.
Sure
Haha probably true (sigh)
Depends on how release to owners with early access goes, but hopefully wide release by end of August
Tesla Service Centers and a lot more Superchargers coming to Poland later this year
Will recognize and read all signs for FSD. Focused on traffic lights and stop signs right now. Most are very easy. Difficulty is millions of corner cases.
Hoping to get “Joe Mode” into V10. The default, of course, is normal volume, but selecting “Joe Mode” would lower the volume of strident beeps and chimes by half.
If not immediately, will be followed shortly in a point release
Yes
Some
Not currently in V10, but will try
Yes, V10 will include several games and infotainment features, improved highway Autopilot, better traffic light and stop sign recognition and Smart Summon
Can’t you just play though phone Bluetooth?
We’re close, but the magic is in the final details. Maybe 2 to 3 months.
Maybe August, not more than a few months
Yeah, feels just like an old school drive in movie experience, but with much better sound
When full self-driving is approved by regulators, we will enable video while moving
Ability to stream YouTube and Netflix when car is stopped coming to your Tesla soon! Has an amazingly immersive, cinematic feel due to the comfy seats and surround sound audio.
Yes, really enjoyed it, although wish she’d made it up to sky city
Unity port is done, so finessing the controls now. Mostly limited by local storage. Will allow additional game storage via USB. Whatever’s most fun!
And those who weren’t expecting a ternary joke

Dr. Livingstone, I presume?
Pc (chamber pressure) high due to colder than expected propellant
Thin tiles on windward side of ship and nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
Wearing black not recommended
High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren’t hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

To be clear: good for in-space transit, but not recommended for Earth to orbit!
Very unlikely
Goodbye 😢

Next year’s competition will be in a 10km vacuum tunnel with a curve

Woohoo 🥳
Orbital refilling is critical for high payload to moon or Mars. Initially just Starship to Starship, later dedicated tankers.

Starship Super Heavy with 35 Raptors
I have the t-shirt
Won’t change. Starship launch structure will be attached to the other side from tower.
Starship launch structure is being built off-site in steel subsections
2 to 3 months after that
It *is* vision
I suspect many besides SpaceX will livestream these flights. Won’t be subtle.
Texas and Florida Starship prototypes (not Hopper) fly in 2 to 3 months
Made with rain ™️
Coming soon
Yes
Tesla Service Centers and Superchargers are being opened as fast as possible across Eastern Europe
This is actually a good thing btw. China is making amazing progress in space, rapidly iterating on rocket and space station technology. Great respect.
No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot
Exactly. Trendline that includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features matches curve of Autopilot software/hardware releases, as you’d expect.
Maybe end of next year
Addressing epilepsy is likely one of the more near-term applications
Post test fuel leak, but no major damage
Aiming for hover test next week
Yeah, big advantage of being made of high strength stainless steel: not bothered by a little heat!
This non-Autopilot graph is not correct, as it includes Autopilot always-on accident avoidance features
Good piece
I mostly drive Model S Performance with dev version of FSD computer. Our new Raven powertain and adaptive damping suspension is great! Next is Model 3P and then X if driving with my kids. Acceleration is fun on tap!

Neuralink surprise twist!
Is there a longer edit I can post?
I think so
Something like this is the best way to do it. Incent outcome, not path.
About to go live
Not easy getting a lightsaber into backpack
Approximately 6.9km/s
♥️👽 SpaceX has Area 59 👽♥️
Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP
“If you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.” — Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
Probably
Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them and we won’t be able to.
No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week
Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.

Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers.
Yeah, that’s next after summon
Will trace back inertial measurements and wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off
Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year
Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.
Agreed, it’s a small, but important, feature
Ok
🔥
Also, I stole the idea from Spaceballs
Take note
About right, but dangerously chuggy and risking bad things at 40%. We’ll keep it above 50% for this flight.
More like 30 to 40 mT to GTO ~27 deg. Plane change is 2*v*sin θ/2, as I recall, but doesn’t matter, as there’s no geo 🛰 anywhere near that mass.
3
100mT to 125mT for true useful load to useful orbit (eg Starlink mission), including propellant reserves. 150mT for reference payload compared to other rockets. This is in fully reusable config. About double in fully expendable config, which is hopefully never.
Cont of main
We changed the design quite a bit. More about this in late July.
~20m up and sideways for first flight. Mk1 Starship hopefully 20km up in a few months.

No, I’m not 😜
That was a real sign
I actually asked Ashlee Vance not to write the book several times. Inevitably, some things are wrong and then those errors are repeated for years.
True
Exactly
No
No
There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago.
This shampoo sounds amazing
No problem

Overall successful. Aborted at T+51 sec on high mixture ratio, but we were intentionally probing the corners of the box of operating conditions, so not surprising.
Exactly
Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car
Between first development engine and first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware and software. Over time, thousands.
Upgrading to 250kW soon
Intersections with complex traffic lights and shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.
Local supporters will be invited!
Yes
~Q4 2016
End of Q4, most likely
Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.
This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k and make at least ~500k FSD cars
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer and all production in past few months has FSD computer
Starship Mk 1 and Hopper

Later in life Bakunin is underappreciated
Listening to Revolutions by Duncan Found this on a throw pillow …

Active safety will continue to improve via over-the-air software updates. Since all Tesla cars are connected, we analyze each accident and do our best to minimize probability of recurrence.
We must safeguard the future of life by transitioning to sustainable energy on Earth and becoming multiplanetary via Mars. It’s not clear how much time we have to do these things, but sooner is definitely better.
Best crash safety system is not crashing in the first place. Makes a world of difference for pedestrians and cyclists especially.
Should be fixed soon
Reason for top rating is that active steering and braking safety features of Tesla Autopilot are turned on no cost for all cars
✌️
Congratulations Tesla team and thanks to all the new Tesla owners!! ♥️♥️

Yep, order online at in 2 mins and car delivered direct to home
Is this true
FWIW, based on calcs I did 10 years ago, cross-over point for Li-ion beating kerosene is ~400 Wh/kg. High cycle batteries are just over 300 Wh/kg today, but probably exceed 400 in ~5 years.
Jet A (kerosene) has much higher energy density than Li-ion, but electric motors weigh much less and convert stored energy to motion better than combustion engines
Yes, but still a bit too limited on range. That will change in coming years as battery energy density improves.
Huge thanks to all Tesla supporters around the world helping the cause. We ♥️♥️♥️ you!!

But, if you’re going to buy a merkin, be sure to haggle properly!
If you don’t already know what a merkin is, don’t google it. You have been warned.
Typing Merlin literally just autocorrected me to merkin 🤣🤣
We poured our heart and soul into it. Lot of hubris too, but no regrets. Fabergé egg of cars.
Hardly anyone noticed, but still
We worked so hard to create that exact view. Seat rails flush with floor on a rear-slanted monopost.
Design and production of The Spirit of St Louis was so incredible
2.1 sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
That’s actually kinda true
Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower and Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent.
~1000, as all seats would be “coach” and no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher and stability of booster in ground winds is low
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
Probably sooner
Ok
Sure, that would be an honor
Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
High entry force and heat breached engine bay and center engine TVC failed
Ok, thanks
:(
Working on Tesla global logistics
I know … sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
Center core RUD. It was a long shot.
He was the real deal

🖤 Tesla Software Engineering 🖤
Falcon Heavy on LC-39A
All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox and fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness and needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗
It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock and strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals and bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
So cool
Anything with high contrast
Excessive shades of grey
Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy and immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.
Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
Haha
Depends on destination
Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design and replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

Tesla is putting significant resources into high-efficiency battery recycling. Makes both environmental and economic sense. Please consider joining if interested in recycling engineering!
No, we’re already recycling them
Yes, demographics, stratified by age, will look like an upside down pyramid with many old people and fewer young
Real issue will an aging and declining world population by 2050, *not* overpopulation. Randers estimate far more accurate than UN imo:

Changing the palette is hell on service, because cars last for 20 years. Every color change has a long tail of hurt, especially for Model 3.

Good question. Will consider thoughtful response.

Good analysis. Both computers will be used and sync ~20 times per second. This is a long time to a computer. Like a twin-engine plane, use both engines to max for normal operation, but can safely operate on just one.

Absolutely agree. Major expansion of service centers underway.
Super fair criticism. We’re putting max resources on this. Hard to hire enough repair technicians in Norway! Please apply if interested.

Good point. Maybe we could collect rainwater, add a little antifreeze in cold climates and make it last for years.
Annual tire rotation is actually optional. Only worthwhile if you see significant differential wear on inside vs outside of tire.

China EV subsidies mostly end this month and fully end in about 7 months
Yes
No problem if you want to post the suggestions on this timeline. It’s great to get thoughtful criticism.
155mph is common on the Autobahn. Even with only 5 offramp tunnels, exit speed drops to 31mph.
Tesla Superchargers and service centers coming to Kazakhstan this year
Yes, as you point out, it will clear up a lot of the misunderstandings
Avg speed of NY Subway is actually 17mph. TBC loop can run at 155mph with 16 pax autopods passing every second, routing automatically between tunnels to their destination. That’s 57,600/hour/lane and you can build dozens of lanes. Will crush any subway in throughput and convenience.
Only cars made in China are eligible for these subsidies. Tesla has never had access to them.

Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further
Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto and oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors and space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity and ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20.
Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result.
Wings/flaps and leg design changing again (sigh). Doesn’t affect schedule much though.
Not bad
Exactly. We’re on the wrong planet for SSTO. No problem on Mars or any of the moons.
Yeah, the fear, uncertainty and doubt propaganda campaign being pushed by those betting against Tesla has reached new heights
I paid most of my Tesla-related expenses too. Tesla last year was actually net negative comp for me.
One day’s grace, taking into account time zone confusion. Will revert tomorrow.
Edgy move
Good idea
True. I’m a gamer and my boys are too. Starlink is designed to be great even for competitive twitch reflex games.
Yup
Would love to do exactly that
Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits and arrays are tracking to sun.
Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.
Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.
Yes, already planned. We avoid use of certain lower Ku frequencies specifically for radio astronomy.
Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that’s easily done. Most orbital objects are close to Earth btw, as shown by this NASA density map.
There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully and will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy. We need to move telelscopes to orbit anyway. Atmospheric attenuation is terrible.
No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
Fair
Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy and internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites and allow some amount of yaw steering.
Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density and thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp and up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.
Whoa cool 😀

Krypton thrusters operative, satellites initiating orbit raise every 90 mins
No
🤣🤣 Absolutely
Yes, 3 to 6 months
Lights would turn off automatically when no motion is detected
Thus *reducing* existing road traffic
Another great thing about many layers of interconnected tunnels with ramps and elevators is that they can go from near your home all way to popping up at destination parking lot
Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below
Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly and directly that it doesn’t matter
Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!
Paperwork and hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it
That would great!
Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!

Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They can’t *both* be true!
Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
This is simple and just works

First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
So it goes
3 months
Hopefully, 4 months
Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly and at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move and increases moment of inertia.
Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees

Sure
Two tunnels about a mile long each
Yes
Makes no sense. In order to grow the colony, you’d have to transport vast amounts of mass from planets/moons/asteroids. Would be like trying to build the USA in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!
Aiming for 150 tons useful load in fully reusable configuration, but should be at least 100 tons, allowing for mass growth
N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces and high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.
