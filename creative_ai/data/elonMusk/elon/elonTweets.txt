We’ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won’t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
Your Twitter comments are great btw!
Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It’s better because of you! ♥️♥️♥️.
This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they’d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs.
There will be no loss of either.
That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width.
True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi.
He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6.
Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels! https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE https://t.co/Sv4JHaXcOx.
Huge admiration &amp; respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent &amp; drive is amazing!
For sure.
If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive.
Launching third flight of this Dragon spacecraft to tomorrow https://t.co/mTQ2DrWS97.
Yes.
After a while, hydrogen became sentient.
Bravo, right thing to do! Short selling should be illegal.
🔥🔥.
People often think they’re breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.).
Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement.
Still can’t believe how hard it was to get https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr!
We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes.
Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!
It’s artificial.
Do you like our owl? https://t.co/4fNOEv3N5b.
Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges &amp; guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture.
Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated.
That’s why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control.
Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel.
They are dead to me.
It’s a generational thing.
With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details. https://t.co/IMLJbsInmq.
Touché.
Just because he has a flamethrower and I have a flamethrower doesn’t mean … um … ok fine I’m Hank Scorpio.
This one is deep. Happy Thanksgiving! https://t.co/2Dog5HBxjX.
The finest in apocalypse protection technology! Flamethrower optional.
🤣🤣.
Def not dainty.
Yes, Cybertruck will have steel balls 🤣🤣.
250k.
We’d be happy to help.
Sure, will aim to do this next week.
Agreed, this will be exciting to see!
Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.
Bring it on https://t.co/pCnln1NdRO.
Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!
200k.
Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn’t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time ….
Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill https://t.co/OfaqUkrDI3.
Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesn’t cost crazy money for ~3mm skins.
In general, this is something Tesla should do.
We should def make it good to hang out there.
Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year.
Good question. It’s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.
Can be wrapped in any color!
The body panels will actually be laser cut!
Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too.
Interesting idea.
True.
🤣🤣.
Really? Ok sure.
Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level.
Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I’m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
⚔️ Study the Blade!! ⚔️ https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI.
We’re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we’ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can’t be made using standard methods.
Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made.
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can’t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press.
Excellent review by Marques! https://t.co/RaXLl30FfF.
187k.
Yes.
Haha v true.
With no advertising &amp; no paid endorsement.
146k Cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor.
Great analysis.
That would be cool.
Gonna have some sick attachments.
🤣🤣.

Franz throws steel ball at Cybertruck window right before launch. Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha. https://t.co/eB0o4tlPoz.
🖤🖤🖤 Syd Mead 🖤🖤🖤 https://t.co/8nbD5LrAQJ.
We threw same steel ball at same window several times right before event &amp; didn’t even scratch the glass!
Better truck than an F-150, faster than a Porsche 911. Order Cybertruck online at https://t.co/hltT8dg2NO.
Yes.
Will be an option to add solar power that generates 15 miles per day, possibly more. Would love this to be self-powered. Adding fold out solar wings would generate 30 to 40 miles per day. Avg miles per day in US is 30.
Tesla 2 person electric ATV will come at first as an option for Cybertruck.
See ya in 2077 😉.
Nobody *expects* the Cybertruck https://t.co/khhYNFaVKs.
Yup.
Haha.
High time we had a Tesla coil!
Cybertruck design influenced partly by The Spy Who Loved Me https://t.co/HKBzxFNfzm.

Tesla Cybertruck (pressurized edition) will be official truck of Mars.
Of course.
Fun party guaranteed!
Long journey.
Tonight https://t.co/pVAv4v1h8b.
Absolutely, but to move to Mk3 design. This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different.
Maybe won’t need a key at all.
So many reporters gave Chanos airtime when he called Tesla a worthless fraud. Now that he has been proven wrong, silence ….

78% of people want to gentrify Mordor.
The China space industry is very impressive.
Cephalopods have a strange intelligence.
It certainly does.
True.
Not sure. Maybe write or message carmakers who oppose the environmental initiative?
Even Toyota, who made the Prius. That is sad.
Guess I was obsessed with space from an early age. Fair point.
I’d be way too embarrassed to put that on a Tesla. It’s like a kid’s drawing.
Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.
Exactly! Well said.
Surprisingly common.
Cybertruck unveil Thursday night https://t.co/AHBxaubdhO.

Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
Bad logic is always ugly.
Same goes for digital super intelligence denial.

141 MPGe! https://t.co/eb8b517Yvk.
Yes.
Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
Pretty much.
Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?
So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable.
As the planets align only once every two years.
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city.
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half.
If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year.
Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year.
The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.
Gas/diesel cars too.
True.
Extremism is so fun! (@waitbutwhy) https://t.co/ECACsaqAXR.
Of course!
Yes.
The date is strangely familiar … https://t.co/YZl5R1POJL.
Cybertruck unveil on Nov 21 in LA near SpaceX rocket factory.
Looking into it.
Yes.
The audience of entrepreneurs should try it, not the AF.
Naturally.
This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called “Pitch Day” &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don’t buy APCs. It’s the Air Force.
Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
More to come.
Yes.
Would be odd to expect anything else.
That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth.
Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.
Great poem.
Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row. https://t.co/Q814zVoW4S.
Putting Model S in range mode is the opposite of launch mode, as it minimizes performance in favor of range. Show should be called “Low Gear”!
Tesla Solarglass vs 🎃 Happy Halloween!! https://t.co/p5tXeJYqne.
Sorry, Drag Times is correct, Top Gear is wrong.
Drag Race Times analysis is correct. Also, there’s a software upgrade for Model S coming out that increases peak power by 50HP, so Model S should beat Porsche Taycan Turbo S by a wider margin in 0 to 60 &amp; 1/4 mile races.
Walking on a Tesla Solarglass roof is definitely no problem!
Thank for helping grow sustainable energy through solar! https://t.co/zH08AMhVMj.

Hard to say with high accuracy, but 4 to 6 weeks is my best guess.
Soon, SpaceX will launch astronauts to https://t.co/wAy5MNqnEI.
That’s significantly improved in current production.
True, my name literally means tree.
If you have autonav enabled, car will automatically navigate either to address in calendar, to work if you’re home &amp; to home if at work. Not sure if that’s in wide release yet, but def in early access. It’s an awesome feature.
Just a reminder that the Tesla Full Self-Driving option goes up by $1000 at midnight on Nov 1 for all regions that have Smart Summon. Order your car online at https://t.co/7FlnbrMxOl.
“I always like going South; somehow, it feels like going downhill.”.
For Treebeard.
Ok, sounds legit, will donate 1M trees.
Sounds cool. Where are the trees being planted &amp; what kind of trees?
Making a roof out of kindling in a fire risk zone is not recommended.
We’re changing this from storm watch to disaster watch to cover fires, earthquakes, etc.
Very true. Glass doesn’t burn &amp; melting point is extremely high, so much more resilient than asphalt or wood roofs.
I hate advertising.
Unfortunately, it’s hard to google Tesla solar links due to tons of ads &amp; SEO. Go to https://t.co/UvQa8JOE7v to add solar to an existing roof &amp; https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE for a new roof with integrated solar.
We don’t make much money on this product, so $1000 actually means a lot.
If you’re directly affected by wildfire power outages, Tesla is reducing Solar+Powerwall prices by $1000 as of today.
Apologies to those waiting for Solar/Powerwall outside California, as we are prioritizing those affected by wildfires.
So true. Imagine if phones were gasoline powered. Total sales would be like 14 units worldwide! Using oil/gas &amp; being forced to constantly visit toxic chemical dispensing stations will seem so insane in the future!
Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow. Adding a Powerwall battery is highly likely to increase home value too imo, as security against blackouts is increasingly important. https://t.co/3y4M5L50qF.
I’d recommend regular solar panels for flat roofs.
Extremely high.
Will do what we can for anyplace affected by natural disasters.
US clean energy incentive drops by 4% on Jan 1, so orders must be received by roughly Nov 15 to be installed in time.

Transparent aluminum is a real thing! https://t.co/hX4XLih1Hk.
That would be cool. Surfaces that see the sun should be alive with power, not inert!
Maybe call Tesla solar roof tiles product Solarglass? Like Dragonglass, but solar!
Gwynne rocks! Starlink will probably be a little bumpy at first, but then improve rapidly.
🔥.
Strange to think that our civilization is only ~5000 years old, if dated from earliest writing. Less than the lifespan of a fruit fly, compared to age of Earth.
To be clear, integrated solar tiles only make financial sense for new houses or replacement roofs. If your roof is more than 5 years away from replacement, solar retrofit is recommended https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9.
California time.
This product may appear simple, but actually *very* difficult to get right.
Will do an open call Q&amp;A.
Major FUD incoming for sure … haha.
🤣🤣.
I have V1, but will switch to V3.
Tesla Solar Tile Roof V3 launch tomorrow at 2pm.
Sure.
But actually … https://t.co/XJNjPHrq2A.
Super proud of Tesla team for great execution &amp; support of Tesla customers greatly appreciated!!
Tesla Q3 results: - Shanghai Giga ahead of schedule - Model Y ahead of schedule - Solar installs +48% from Q2 - GAAP profitable - Positive free cash flow.
The big rear wing is only on for one day for rear downforce calibration. Isn’t needed to set ring record &amp; won’t be in the production car.
Internal camera isn’t used yet (meant for robotaxi), but that’s a good idea.
Please lmk about your experience and what can be improved.
Coming soon.
Whoa, it worked!!
Sending this tweet through space via Starlink satellite 🛰.
Homes with solar sell for 4.1% more, according to Zillow https://t.co/EtqGAxDlAF.
More carrot, less stick.
Very likely that a home with clean power that’s lower cost than utility, plus blackout protection via Powerwall, will have a positive effect on value.
PG&amp;E says rolling blackouts expected in California for next 10 years! https://t.co/Iv9f0piK82.
Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no blackouts! https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9.
Going offline for a few days.
Both at the same time!
More about dealing with failure modes &amp; roll control.
Need to deal with thrust asymmetry from flameout of an engine without forcing shutdown of opposing pair engine, which would double thrust loss. Also, thrust differential doesn’t solve roll control well.
Common myth, but incorrect.
And so begins the robocalypse ….
Tesla wins best headlights award 🥇 https://t.co/SjvA931B3U https://t.co/8yfeJiXd0N.
The final configuration used at Nürburgring to set the record will go into production around summer 2020, so this is not merely for the track.
Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing &amp; building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you ….
Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit.
Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard.
And the lead character is also named Woody https://t.co/ZxK84rB020.
Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines.
Conservation of energy tells you the answer.
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table.
Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq.
This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU.
Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.
We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces.
Yeah, great team!
To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq.
Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly ….
Software.
Yes.
Will start rendering traffic cones in the display soon.
Venus would be very difficult.
True.
Yes, we will.
It is actually called deep rain, as sort of a joke at Tesla. Takes a surprising amount of deep learning to know when &amp; how fast to move the wipers.
Deep Rain™️ neural net coming soon. We’re not trademarking any other Autopilot neural nets, just this one, because rain is deep.
Yep, good catch.
♥️ hot pot.
Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future.
Those rumors are false.

Underappreciated 🎥, will watch!
Is Space Jam good?
So it goes.
Sure looks that way.
Nice 🤣🤣.
Solar.
Depends on total system efficiency &amp; how long the propellant plant can run to refill Starship, so 1 to 10MW as a rough guess.
Whoa, that does look good!
Fair point. Will hold on EU price change until Tesla gets clarity from regulators about Smart Summon feature release date.
French fries 🍟 are the devil 😈 https://t.co/AR3h57RPIA.
.@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists (Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?
Super messed up situation!
Several finesse improvements coming to Smart Summon in coming weeks. Will be smooth as silk.
Should be much better at this point.
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts.
Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ….
Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid.
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
😉.
Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released.
Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive.
Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1.
Get Tesla Solar plus Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power &amp; no more blackouts! https://t.co/mDoPO17YB9.
Will be throughout Canada.
It’s something special.
Fundamental metric of good of Tesla is how many years sooner it brings the advent of a sustainable energy future.
True 🤣🤣.
I ♥️ Asterix &amp; Obelix!
Exactly.
Ok.
Also adding Tesla Solar to our Supercharger stations as fast as possible. Goal is 24/7 clean power with no blackouts.
All Tesla Supercharger stations in regions affected by California power outages will have Tesla Powerpacks within next few weeks. Just waiting on permits.

Worth reading “Human Compatible” by Stuart Russell (he’s great!) about future AI risks &amp; solutions https://t.co/ZCdvZrrcVf.
All hardware is at the Cape. Need to do static fire and reconfigure for flight. Launch probably late Nov / early Dec.
We had to reallocate some resources to speed this up &amp; received great support from Airborne, our parachute supplier. I was at their Irvine factory with the SpaceX team on Sat and Sun. We’re focusing on the advanced Mk3 chute, which provides highest safety factor for astronauts.
For what it’s worth, the SpaceX schedule, which I’ve just reviewed in depth, shows Falcon &amp; Dragon at the Cape &amp; all testing done in ~10 weeks.

If 20km works, then orbit.
Great summary of the key points!
That’s about right, except no sensors. Tile itself is the sensor as it will partially ablate where too hot &amp; have to be replaced.
It’s all the “secondary” structure that concerns me, not engines &amp; primary airframe.
Raptor cost is tracking to well under $1M for V1.0. Goal is &lt;$250k for V2.0 is a 250 ton thrust-optimized engine, ie &lt;$1000/ton.
Stop sending me this 💩 🤣🤣.
Agreed &amp; such a heartwarming photo ♥️.
I have that exact thought every time I get the flu.
Clearly a sign of the apocalypse!
Lot of ways to melt &amp; join steel. Mostly just needs to be welded consistently &amp; with precise parts.
Thankfully not. FSW is very difficult to get right &amp; not needed with steel.
Production version will be a lot more polished than this prototype, but still fun to see.
Bigger flaps/fins at rear also moves center of pressure back.
