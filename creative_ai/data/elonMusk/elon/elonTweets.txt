@teslaownersSV We‚Äôll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won‚Äôt do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.
@Kristennetten Your Twitter comments are great btw!
Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It‚Äôs better because of you! 2
@Kristennetten This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they‚Äôd like in a product is a great way to meet their needs
@Real_John_D @Teslarati @tesla_raj There will be no loss of either
@flcnhvy @Teslarati @tesla_raj That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width
@Everman @Teslarati @tesla_raj True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.
@Teslarati @tesla_raj We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.
Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi
@JoeWBowles @BillGates He‚Äôs def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6

@Erdayastronaut Really? Ok sure.

@vicentes Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I‚Äôm confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.
‚öîÔ∏è Study the Blade!! ‚öîÔ∏è https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI
@annerajb @flcnhvy We‚Äôre creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we‚Äôll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can‚Äôt be made using standard methods.
@flcnhvy Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.
Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made
Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can‚Äôt stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press

@stephenjudkins @flcnhvy Yes
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year.
@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!
@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far).
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half
@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year
@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year
@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

@justpaulinelol @Teslarati Naturally
@Teslarati This is based on an incorrect Electrek article. The Air Force asked me to speak at a startup conference called ‚ÄúPitch Day‚Äù &amp; I happened to mention Cybertruck. They don‚Äôt buy APCs. It‚Äôs the Air Force.
@WillFealey @Teslarati Fair point. Coming soon. We‚Äôre making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
@Teslarati Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software.
@cleantechnica More to come
@bob_burrough Yes
@rafaelcr @OfWudan Would be odd to expect anything else
@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth
@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed.

@NotEricRalph @MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines
@TTownJoe @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Conservation of energy tells you the answer
@Ingvar_Oolsen @neiltyson @Space_Station Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
@MartianDays @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @AerojetRdyne We def could be wrong about this, but it‚Äôs actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place &amp; only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don‚Äôt need a lot of room &amp; moment of inertia is much lower.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Also, we‚Äôre keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that‚Äôs leaving a lot on the table
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W &gt; 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with &gt;260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably &lt;120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now.
@Erdayastronaut @torybruno @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2. https://t.co/LijrUMuJDq
@torybruno @Erdayastronaut @MartianDays @AerojetRdyne This is true. All that matters is number used in ‚àÜv equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass. https://t.co/s2LcEapGAU
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen &amp; oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters.

@Sofiaan @annerajb @tesla_addicted Yeah, great team!
@J_ump_er @neiltyson @Space_Station To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. https://t.co/21hICWczMq
@HarryStoltz1 @neiltyson @Space_Station Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere.
@neiltyson @Space_Station Most people aren‚Äôt aware that orbit (and ‚Äúzero‚Äù gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space.
@NASASpaceflight @IanPineapple Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear &amp; drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly ‚Ä¶

@wk057 @Tesla Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
@brockm Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry ‚Ä¶
@bruce_mittleman Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist.
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout.
@cutza7 When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you‚Äôll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many &amp; much better than driving a single car.
@tesla_addicted @sanjeev_r11 @vincent13031925 Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that‚Äôs problematic above ~30 deg latitude.

@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Just SX500 so far, but we use many superalloys developed by others, eg Inco 718+. If anyone has 718++, that would be helpful haha. Massive engineering work in the casting, printing &amp; machining of Raptor ‚Äî far more than in design of the engine itself!
@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE There‚Äôs so much power going through this engine that it‚Äôs close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
@Carter__99 @Erdayastronaut @askingbubble385 @Cor_SPACE Yes
@Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints &amp; dissimilar metals at such high pressure &amp; temperature is what I find remarkable about it.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE No, we‚Äôve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have &amp; we‚Äôll get around to it, but not needed for flight.
@NCBirbhan @Erdayastronaut @Cor_SPACE Probably around 6 or 7pm

@annerajb @Jennerator211 @Erdayastronaut With rare exceptions, composites would make Starship heavier. They don‚Äôt stand up well to high temperatures, but steel does great.

@The_ShadowZone @DJSnM For sure more than one pass coming back to Earth. To Mars could maybe work single pass, but two passes probably wise.
@OranMaliphant @Erdayastronaut Could do it, but we developed low cost reusable tiles that are much lighter than transpiration cooling &amp; quite robust
@Erdayastronaut Better just to ride your max temp all the way down &amp; let T^4 be your friend. Lower atmosphere cools you down real fast, so not crazy hot after landing.
@DJSnM Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.
@Erdayastronaut It does actually generate lift in hypersonic regime, which is important to limit peak heating

@happych19952208 üòâ
@CptnCrutch5373 @Erdayastronaut @Kalzsom Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle &amp; ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
@Kalzsom @Erdayastronaut For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass &amp; pressure.
@Erdayastronaut Current analysis, which I‚Äôm not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2
@Erdayastronaut Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear &amp; fwd fins during entry &amp; landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward ‚Äúfin‚Äù would simply be used as a leg.
@Erdayastronaut Stability is not an issue with 3
@SpaceXFan97 Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors &amp; rear fins at the bottom.
@SpaceXFan97 Yes. There‚Äôs a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven‚Äôt closed it out.

Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries &amp; drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs &amp; improve logistics worldwide.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners Should note that these product mix &amp; logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK &amp; Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous &amp; possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it
@teslaownersSV @Kristennetten @Model3Owners At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes &amp; logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.
@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world.
@flcnhvy @hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Agreed
@hoofhrtd1254 @Teslatunity @Model3Owners Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval.
@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.
@Model3Owners Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining.

@nate_mccomb @Teslarati 48 61 20 68 61
@Teslarati The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal.
@Erdayastronaut @JHC2718 @MagnussonMani @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Failure rate is actually both higher &amp; lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate.
@Erdayastronaut @IvanEscobosa @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Precisely
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you‚Äôll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox &amp; fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you‚Äôre prob ok.
@Erdayastronaut @vicvic21266 @flcnhvy @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric ü§£ü§£
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric You know destination weather before departure &amp; there‚Äôs no weather in space
@flcnhvy @DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Everything happens so fast. It‚Äôs such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.
@DJSnM @Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell &amp; fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull.
@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that‚Äôs not indicative of capability.
@Erdayastronaut @KevinKling12 @DJSnM @spaceXcentric Over time, 355 &amp; 385 are possible, but very difficult

@justpaulinelol Not risky imo &amp; can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system‚Äôs fusion reactor (the sun).
@wingod @DJSnM @ThePhoenixFlare True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids &amp; a mass driver, but this is risky.
Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive.
@JaneidyEve Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins &amp; landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September
@HarryStoltz1 @ThePhoenixFlare Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
@ThePhoenixFlare Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth &amp; gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming

@TeslaClubIN @Yashwanthnadal For other countries, we pay in part for the local factory by selling cars there ahead of time. Also, gives a sense of demand. Current rules in India prevent that, but recent changes in sales tax give hope for future changes.
@hi__hassan Not sure. Will check with my team.
@Yashwanthnadal I‚Äôm told import duties are extremely high (up to 100%), even for electric cars. This would make our cars unaffordable.
@SciGuySpace Orbital refilling is vital to humanity‚Äôs future in space. More likely spacecraft to spacecraft (as aircraft do aerial refueling), than a dedicated depot, at least at first.

@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Thin tiles on windward side of ship &amp; nothing on leeward or anywhere on booster looks like lightest option
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Testing a possible Starship windward side ceramic tile. Maximizing emissivity is best for conductive/particle heating. Nice thing about steel is that tiles can be very thin, unlike carbon fiber or aluminum airframe.
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit Wearing black not recommended https://t.co/lqoBFTeMX2
@Erdayastronaut @goathobbit High reflectivity minimizes photonic heating, high emissivity minimizes particle heating. No need to radiate heat away if you aren‚Äôt hot in the first place. Also, as metal heats up to yellow/red/white, it stops being reflective.

@hypercharts @ElonsWorld @Tesla No matter how one considers the data, there is a giant improvement from non-Autopilot to Autopilot

@ThisIsJonathanR @Its1754 @krkaiser @ropiko Agreed, should be $3k less to get to FSD from EAP
‚ÄúIf you dislike change, you're going to dislike irrelevance even more.‚Äù ‚Äî Gen Shinseki
As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit.
@JeanLikeDenim Probably
@ropiko Agreed. That‚Äôs approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them &amp; we won‚Äôt be able to.
@flcnhvy @SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers
@SnazzyQ @PhenomenalPoto @aaronjleonard @tailosivetech If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week

@SpaceXFan97 @lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower &amp; Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
@lister6520 @justpaulinelol @MattLBates @Erdayastronaut You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.
@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent.
@Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin ~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù &amp; no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands.
@YusifzadaAgshin About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips.
@Erdayastronaut @SciGuySpace That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher &amp; stability of booster in ground winds is low
@C3LT_Games @SciGuySpace There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
@ebelliveau @SciGuySpace Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible.
@SciGuySpace Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work.
@Cocalarix @romaarra Probably sooner
@romaarra Ok
@TherrinKSCVC @SteelSully @annerajb @kickber @ExploreSpaceKSC Sure, that would be an honor
@Erdayastronaut @justpaulinelol @MattLBates Most likely. It is programmed to do so.

@MattLBates @Erdayastronaut I know ‚Ä¶ sigh. Those are truly a work of art.
@SptlightVids @SpaceX Yes, but we couldn‚Äôt take a chance on 2nd stage failing it‚Äôs 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I‚Äôm aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well.
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
@SpaceXUpdates @Erdayastronaut High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
@Erdayastronaut Center core RUD. It was a long shot.

Falcon Heavy on LC-39A https://t.co/FsfFa7bRRK
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox &amp; fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness &amp; needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor.
@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
@engadget So cool
@soswow @elontimes Anything with high contrast
@teslaownersSV @elontimes Excessive shades of grey
@elontimes Yeah, we‚Äôve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous.
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy &amp; immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps.

@EvaFoxU Haha
@joe_mckirdy @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Depends on destination
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1.
@DatKlow Chomsky sucks
Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://t.co/kzjh26eIEn
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
@Erdayastronaut @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy More than that now, but &lt;10% of that in volume, although much to be proven
@HarryStoltz1 @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design &amp; replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year.

@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science.

@1DarknessSoul5 @SpaceX Aiming for sub 20ms latency initially, sub 10ms over time, with much greater consistency than terrestrial links, as only ever a few hops to major data centers
@13ericralph31 @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX If we need to tweak sat orientation to minimize solar reflection during critical astronomical experiments, that‚Äôs easily done.

@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency.
@meme0boi Fair
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy &amp; internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
@DJSnM Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites &amp; allow some amount of yaw steering.
@SPEXcast @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars.
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density &amp; thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp &amp; up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum.

@flcnhvy @Malcolmmarsman @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX First flights would have fewer, so as to risk less loss of hardware. Probably around 20.
@InsideEVs So it goes
@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX 3 months
@flcnhvy @marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Hopefully, 4 months
@marstronauts @Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly &amp; at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move &amp; increases moment of inertia.
@Erdayastronaut @JaneidyEve @13ericralph31 @SPEXcast @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @SpaceX Yeah. Outer engines with much larger nozzles are fixed to airframe, inner engines have high gimbal range ~15 degrees

@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX N2 for vacuum. Aero surfaces &amp; high gimbal angle main engines for atmosphere.
@SPEXcast @13ericralph31 @JaneidyEve @bluemoondance74 @Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Hoping for 380 sec Isp, but at least 370. Otherwise similar to sea level version.

@Orion_Sword @Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX But, essentially, the spinning things
@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Yes
@Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Turbopump propellant flow path to achieve high chamber pressure is quite tricky. Requires an inducer &amp; 2 impellers with ~100,000 shaft horsepower.

@FredericLambert Fred, every fire *is* investigated. Problem is those who only write about 0 injury Tesla fires while ignoring fatal combustion car fires or fail to mention any contextual statistics in their article, misleading readers into thinking EV‚Äôs have high fire risk when opposite is true.
@teslaownersSV @jeffleach Thanks, support super appreciated
@jeffleach Sad if true üòî
When you read double standard articles about Tesla, please ask why. Maybe there‚Äôs a good reason that isn‚Äôt obvious.
Reality is a Tesla, like most electric cars, is over 500% *less* likely to catch fire than combustion engine cars, which carry massive amounts of highly flammable fuel. Why is this never mentioned?
Over a million combustion engine (it‚Äôs right there in the name!) car fires per year &amp; thousands of deaths, but one Tesla car fire with no injuries gets biggest headlines. Why the double standard? This is a real question.
Those who predicted Tesla &amp; EVs would be dead &amp; autonomy would never happen are same people attacking Tesla today for 6-12 month delays, while ignoring major automakers 5+ years late. Why the double standard?
Almost all coverage back then said hydrogen fuel cells would destroy electric cars &amp; autonomy was between 10 years &amp; never ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/bT2ZbnN8Yd

@EforElectric @WSJ That tweet did take immense effort ü§£ü§£ Fair point tho. Powerwall production is now ramping fast. Tesla was cell-starved last year, so we had to switch all lines to make packs for cars, which meant Powerwall production was living off scraps.

@arctechinc @danahull @GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla @SEC_Enforcement Haha true
@martinengwicht @KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb @Tesla @ElonMuskScience I‚Äôve always thought that the fundamental good of Tesla should be measured by the number of years by which it accelerates the transition to sustainable transport &amp; energy
@cSharp3x7 @Savis1949 @WSJ Good point, small oil is a problem too
@FredericLambert @GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ I‚Äôm sorry, Fred, but WSJ has relentlessly attacked Tesla with bogus articles for over a decade. They can‚Äôt *all* be chalked up to poor reporting. Where are the WSJ expos√© pieces on oil, coal &amp; gas? That industry is 1000 times bigger than Tesla. Perhaps they‚Äôre all angels ‚Ä¶
@GinoG01328427 @Savis1949 @WSJ @Tesla Yes, this was an utter boldface (literally) lie! Unbelievable that WSJ would write something so false.
@GilesGraves @Savis1949 @WSJ True, Bloomberg is almost as bad
@Savis1949 @WSJ Holman Jenkins &amp; WSJ in general are sock üß¶ puppets of big oil
@grzf_ Starship is kinda Gundam
@KnightmarArchon @EvBite @johnrobb Very much so. There are 2.5B cars &amp; trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that‚Äôs a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -&gt; demand &gt;&gt; supply.
@Teslarati Sentry Mode fundamentally empowers the individual car owner over entrenched interests, in this case a corrupt traffic judge. Even Tesla doesn‚Äôt have access to the video unless sent to us by owner.

@tsrandall Wow, a lot of people don‚Äôt know much about how manufacturing works! If you have peak capacity of X, actual average weekly output will necessarily be less than X. First 6-12 months, it will be much less than X. Impossible to predict exact production ramp S-curve.
@tsrandall There is 35 GWh/yr ‚Äútheoretical capacity‚Äù, but actual max output is ~2/3. It was physically impossible to make more Model 3‚Äôs in Q1 due to cell constraints.
@CalinRoman3 @GregMatson Yes
@GregMatson Yes, all cars with Autopilot 2.0 or higher, so ~400,000 of Tesla cars built to date
@Erdayastronaut @kneibert Your interventions do train the NN, but we first verify that the training doesn‚Äôt cause other issues, so expect step rather than continuous changes in capability
@FredericLambert Yes
@yaypie There will be that too, but economics will favor initial purchase
@Rebel44CZ Hopefully have the order page live before then. If not, will push price change out a bit later.
@brandonbernicky @tsrandall Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
@tsrandall Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr &amp; have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won‚Äôt spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

@TeslaAnswers @flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag We‚Äôre going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot &amp; fast, so dicey.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can‚Äôt. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that‚Äôs very rare.
@flcnhvy @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year‚Äôs vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer &amp; max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying.
@Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Probably no fairing either &amp; just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what‚Äôs there. Not impossible.
@emilmelar Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it‚Äôs slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2.
@MacBenTosh Anyone who bought FSD will get it
Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 &amp; HW3. Going forward ‚ÄúHW3‚Äù will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. https://t.co/lICMpT7xnX
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @DiscoverMag Yes. Sensitive propulsion &amp; avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.

@SidewalkSciGuy @SpacexFan9876 @Erdayastronaut @Sloppy93 @annerajb @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium &amp; carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint.
@Some1gg Transpiration cooling will be added wherever we see erosion of the shield. Starship needs to be ready to fly again immediately after landing.  Zero refurbishment.

@annerajb @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 We decided to skip building a new nosecone for Hopper. Don‚Äôt need it. What you see being built is the orbital Starship vehicle.
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 You can deep throttle on single shaft system by choking flow of fuel or oxygen between pump &amp; combustion chamber. Problem is more with the tiny rocket engine that powers the pump, called a gas generator. That has to throttle *way* deeper than the main chamber.
@nextspaceflight @Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Working on regulatory approval for both Boca Chica, Texas, and Cape Kennedy, Florida. Will also be building Starship &amp; Super Heavy simultaneously in both locations.
@THE_REAL_KEAGAN @Tesla @LikeTeslaKim @BenSullins @teslainventory Agreed
@Erdayastronaut @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Raptor is *very* complex, even for a staged combustion engine. We‚Äôre simplifying as much as possible with each iteration. Throttling down to ~50% is hard, but manageable. Going to 25% would be extremely tough, but hopefully not needed.
@omarqazi @flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Started rolling it out a few days ago. Always starts slow, find rare corner case issues, fix them, continue rollout ‚Ä¶
@flcnhvy @austinbarnard45 Hopefully. Always many issues integrating engine &amp; stage. First hops will lift off, but only barely.
@austinbarnard45 First (really short) hops with one engine. Suborbital flights with three.

@lexiheft @vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Definitely down the road, once construction &amp; upgrades aren‚Äôt so crazy
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla This causes some media confusion, as batch builds &amp; ship arrival times can make our sales seem incredible one month &amp; terrible following month, but consumer tastes don‚Äôt actually vary so much. Massive month over month changes are usually because of production/shipping schedules.
@vincent13031925 @dave_ross @Tesla Not exactly same time, as countries have different regulations &amp; we try to build in batches to simplify production
@dave_ross @Tesla Might arrive by June, but def before end of summer
@TrevorMahlmann @Tesla @PopMech Model 3 partial permanent magnet induction motor, especially with silicon carbide inverter, is so efficient that it outdoes two induction motors. If we could decouple forward induction motor to avoid spin losses, then range of dual might be higher, but that‚Äôs a lot of complexity.
@ColinRossUBC827 @Tesla @PopMech Exactly! In fact, better to have RWD with winter tires than AWD with summer tires. We appreciate the extra expenditure if people do buy AWD, but it isn‚Äôt critical for snowy regions.
@Tesla @PopMech Still get this question a lot, even though Norway üá≥üá¥ has highest Tesla cars per person on üåè (super appreciated!). Also, AWD is nice to have, but def not required for snow/ice.

@FredericLambert @jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla In retrospect, lower price shouldn‚Äôt have been offered. Was done so because some simply couldn‚Äôt afford it. Prices revert to normal on Monday.
@johnny0129 However, this obviously cannot be discussed with entire global stores team beforehand or news would leak
@johnny0129 We are still closing stores, just not as many as before. This basically splits the difference ‚Äî about half as many stores closed, but then can afford only about half the price reduction. Was discussed with exec team &amp; board.
@jeffborden_cga @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell @Tesla When prices go down, those who already bought want the lower price, but, if prices go up, those who already bought don‚Äôt want to write Tesla a check. So it goes.
@soundanswer @marc_benton @MrTommyCampbell Yes

@comeaujo @ValueAnalyst1 @Tesla Getting rid of peak power splitting across two bays &amp; updated software with battery warmup results in &gt;2X improvement in fleet charge time
@flcnhvy We will spend 3 or 6 months with public beta of V3 in North America, make sure there are no corner case issues &amp; then begin buildout worldwide.
Those improvements are independent of Supercharger V3 power increase from 135kW to 250+kW. All factors considered, charge time will drop by factor of 4 best case &amp; more than 2 for whole Tesla fleet. Effectively, this more than doubles total WW Supercharger system throughput.
Latest software improves Tesla Supercharger times by up to 25% for all Tesla S/X/3 worldwide, incl original 2012 Model S. Not splitting power across 2 Supercharger stalls helps all cars up to 50%. https://t.co/h2MMBjkzLu

@Erdayastronaut @MarekCyzio @katlinegrey Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that.
@Geopilot @katlinegrey Don‚Äôt know
@katlinegrey SpaceX commercial üöÄ launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. https://t.co/sqAYCCcJtd
@martinengwicht @macodiseas @katlinegrey Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species.
@fan_of_racing @bkent136 @macodiseas @katlinegrey SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight &amp; thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics.

@SPEXcast @McMurchie @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress &amp; setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!
@McMurchie @SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship‚Äôs success
@epoxy101 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX At least 10X cheaper
@SPEXcast @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Very dependent on volume, but I‚Äôm confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k &amp; maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth &amp; move to Mars if they want.
@SpaceXFan97 @Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes
@Robotbeat @John_Gardi @SpaceX This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9
@13ericralph31 @John_Gardi @SpaceX Close
@John_Gardi @SpaceX But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter.
@SpaceXFan97 @alexmd2 @SpaceX Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
@_cgp @SpaceX Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 &amp; O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.
@John_Gardi @SpaceX Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky.
@13ericralph31 @SpaceX I think 6 where we lit main chamber &amp; several with only preburners
@johnkrausphotos @SpaceX About 11 secs
@alexmd2 @SpaceX Definitely! It‚Äôs amazing that the RD-170 &amp; RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.

@Erdayastronaut @LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi Booster center of mass is much lower &amp; more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!
@LytovchenkoSerg @John_Gardi @Erdayastronaut Rocket booster temperatures won‚Äôt go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body &amp; maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind.
@Malcolmmarsman @Erdayastronaut Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
@Erdayastronaut Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles.
@Erdayastronaut The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just ‚ÄúStarship‚Äù &amp; sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy

@nickynaptime Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher &amp; doesn‚Äôt even need paint!
@SpaceXFan97 @wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
@wonderofscience @Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Mostly true
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps &amp; main engines for landing orientation, so won‚Äôt need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably.
@TriTexan @SpaceX Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship &amp; booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) &amp; sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas https://t.co/8JCOi1BG6z
@Treebeard1671 @Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes. It‚Äôs very rare to find all three.
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 To be clear, I‚Äôm confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature &amp; reduced need for heat shielding
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime &amp; angle of attack
@Erdayastronaut @keego73 Absolutely. You‚Äôve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

@Robotbeat @zackpio Actual tanks are fine
@Teslarati ~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati I just heard. 50 mph winds broke the mooring blocks late last night &amp; fairing was blown over. Will take a few weeks to repair.
@Teslarati 310S stainless is better for high temp outer skin, as it can take ~1450 Kelvin, so active cooling with cryogenic fuel only has to mitigate 300 degrees of delta temp
@CabsandSurfaces Almost ready to roll out. Regulators just approved.

Tesla Sentry Mode coming soon for all cars with Enhanced Autopilot https://t.co/x2buQWiABX
@DevClub_Space @RationalEtienne @PopMech Yes. Also, despite high outside heat, rapid water vaporization can counter-intuitively cause it to snap freeze &amp; block cooling channels.
@thecla6771 Coming soon. Lots of unique road markings &amp; signs in each country.
@PopMech When going to ~1750 Kelvin, specific heat is more important than latent heat of vaporization, which is why cryogenic fuel is a slightly better choice than water

@WevolverApp @SpaceX Dragon 2 was originally designed to land with thrusters, but it‚Äôs not the right architecture for heavy transport to the moon or Mars, so we decided not to qualify it for thruster landings
@cleantechnica How many electric vehicle startups are there? Seems like a lot.
@musicnick1985 @Teslarati Teslarati is very thoughtful &amp; well-written, but this stems from a miscommunication by SpaceX
@nextspaceflight @Teslarati The LA Times has a long track of unreasonable attacks on SpaceX &amp; Tesla, but in this case it was our miscommunication
@Teslarati The source info is incorrect. Starship &amp; Raptor development is being done out of our HQ in Hawthorne, CA. We are building the Starship prototypes locally at our launch site in Texas, as their size makes them very difficult to transport.

@NutmegTheRed @Tesla Ok
@westcoastbill Tesla team did a great job!
@teslaownersSV @alexraikos 2020
@alexraikos Yes
@SeanABragg @EcoHeliGuy @13ericralph31 @NCBirbhan @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
@EcoHeliGuy @13ericralph31 @NCBirbhan @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
@13ericralph31 @NCBirbhan @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Exactly
@Kristennetten @13ericralph31 @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Yes
@13ericralph31 @AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis Probability at 60% &amp; rising rapidly due to new architecture
@AwakenedParadi1 @demishassabis 30%
@demishassabis Congratulations
@ckgaparajita Coming soon
@whatsinside Yes
@5AllanLeVito Got it üòÄüá∫üá¶
@motorsep Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville &amp; across Mexico.
@JimJimroger Yep
@Dodo723 Yes
Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey. https://t.co/7FQZgLCTVJ
Most people don‚Äôt know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China https://t.co/ZzN9Tabq8C
@martinmeany We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities &amp; working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
@magoo5042 @Tesla Ok
@JP_Cautillo Wow!
@JT_Richards @MMelinot @chuckyyyd This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.
Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:
https://t.co/FZVNlGWYgA
And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it‚Äôs electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements.
There are also many state &amp; local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities &amp; access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://t.co/lmD3ZNFR9M
Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
Merry Christmas &amp; goodwill to all!!

@AndrewSamoylich @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ...
@lexfridman @Tesla @karpathy Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent.
@cleantechnica Sigh
@john_bowie Yes
@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side
@vicentes @Tesla Glad you‚Äôre ok!
@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Starship will look like liquid silver
@elliemecham @whatsinside Haha ü§£
@Kristennetten @rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Maybe
@rokosslav @grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Much less
@grafikhure_de @StevenHardison Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.
@Sloppy93 3
@StevenHardison Usable strength/weight of full hard stainless at cryo is slightly better than carbon fiber, room temp is worse, high temp is vastly better

@nextPlanetOver @WorldAndScience When it‚Äôs no longer noticeable over Planck‚Äôs length
@WorldAndScience Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth‚Äôs gravitational reach is infinite. ‚ÄúZero gravity‚Äù is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.

@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
@Robotbeat @Jon128123 @Diver2441 @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @alan1bernard SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions.
@BENBALLER Thanks!
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard It‚Äôs embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard You def don‚Äôt want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That‚Äôs not a typo.
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level.
@NASASpaceflight @_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
@Erdayastronaut @ludan27 @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem.
@_Synders @John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word ‚Äústar‚Äù or ‚Äúlink‚Äù üòÄ
@ludan27 @Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster &amp; orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well &amp; thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons &amp; Mars.
@John_Gardi @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Coldformed at cryo
@Malcolmmarsman @TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height &amp; diameter.
@TheMuddySchmuck @martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard We‚Äôre building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
@thescalex @Jonas123denmark @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Exactly
@martinengwicht @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry.
@johnkrausphotos @Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yes
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we‚Äôre building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April
@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel &amp; we‚Äôre using a different alloy mix. I super ‚ô•Ô∏è 300 Series Stainless!
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design
@Erdayastronaut @JeromeJaccard @Robotbeat @alan1bernard Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys &amp; new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized.
@wangmeister If Tesla committed delivery &amp; customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference
@alan1bernard Coming soon
@wangmeister It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end
@MikeKasprzik @Tesla Try connecting to WiFi
Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can‚Äôt take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

@JohnKasich Thanks, will consider next year
@nichegamer @boringcompany So long as the tunnels are spaced about one diameter apart, most of the stress will flow around them, but this won‚Äôt matter for the first few layers

Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: https://t.co/LS4EhN57Mw

@DeadstockNYC Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) &amp; tow or flatbed it out
@vicentes @Attack @Tesla Ok üòÄüí®
@EcoHeliGuy @Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla Autopilot doesn‚Äôt need the guide wheels. They‚Äôre only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? https://t.co/vxcZ2Hi2qx
@Robotbeat @michaelknaepen @ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Exactly
@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume.
@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees.
@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces.
@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument.
@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear.
@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!
@realkrauswife I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles &amp; let people decide what makes them happy
A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated &amp; belted for high speed safety.
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
@joshjob42 @flaneur @boringcompany Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
@CasPiancey @boringcompany This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go
The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination &amp; then drives on normal roads back to start
@flaneur @boringcompany Actually way more capacity, way faster &amp; way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it‚Äôs time to upgrade to something better.
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians &amp; cyclists
Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city.
@alanrrios @boringcompany Yes
This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla
