    "We\u2019ll aim to have it come out same time as truck. Two seater electric ATV designed to work with Cybertruck will be fun! Electric dirt bikes would be cool too. We won\u2019t do road bikes, as too dangerous. I was hit by a truck &amp; almost died on one when I was 17.\n",
    "Your Twitter comments are great btw!\n",
    "Huge thanks to everyone who contributed ideas to Cybertruck. It\u2019s better because of you! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f.\n",
    "This may sound crazy, but asking real people what they\u2019d like in a product is a great way to meet their needs.\n",
    "There will be no loss of either.\n",
    "That will require a full redesign, but probably ~73 inches or ~185 cm width.\n",
    "True, more for parking at destination. Really needs to fit in same external envelope as a full-size SUV, but with better height control with air suspension, so it can fit in low clearance parking garages.\n",
    "We can prob reduce width by an inch &amp; maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.\n",
    "Speed solves everything https://t.co/DGYlfyInxi.\n",
    "He\u2019s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA. This analysis goes through calcs https://t.co/fI1I452tm6.\n",
    "Super strong roof that generates clean energy, looks great &amp; costs less than a normal roof plus solar panels! https://t.co/D9yUuL7NVE https://t.co/Sv4JHaXcOx.\n",
    "Huge admiration &amp; respect for the Tesla China team. Their talent &amp; drive is amazing!\n",
    "For sure.\n",
    "If we create a city on Mars, Earth-Mars travel will be a powerful forcing function for inventing something like warp drive.\n",

    "People often think they\u2019re breathing oxygen, but are actually breathing nitrogen (78%) with a side serving of oxygen (21%) in argon sauce (1%), spiced up with CO2, H2O &amp; a dash of neon &amp; krypton (etc.).\n",
    "Hydrogen is a light, odorless gas, which, given enough time, turns into people who will make this statement.\n",
    "Still can\u2019t believe how hard it was to get https://t.co/46TXqRrsdr!\n",
    "We sent the nicest person in the company to sit on his doorstep until he at least talked to us &amp; then he said yes.\n",
    "Tesla was almost called Faraday, as original holder of Tesla Motors trademark refused to sell it to us!\n",
    "It\u2019s artificial.\n",
    "Do you like our owl? https://t.co/4fNOEv3N5b.\n",
    "Overall shape is good for low drag coefficient. Matters a lot exactly how you trip airflow at edges &amp; guide air around wheels, like an invisible sculpture.\n",
    "Laminar air flow due to a completely smooth bottom is underappreciated.\n",
    "That\u2019s why Cybertruck has active suspension height &amp; damping control.\n",
    "Safety work is done by engineering, with passive safety by body/chassis eng &amp; active by Autopilot. Design in automotive refers to look &amp; feel.\n",
    "They are dead to me.\n",
    "It\u2019s a generational thing.\n",
    "With extreme effort, Cybertruck might hit a 0.30 drag coefficient, which would be insane for a truck. Requires tweaking many small details. https://t.co/IMLJbsInmq.\n",
    "Touch\u00e9.\n",
    "Just because he has a flamethrower and I have a flamethrower doesn\u2019t mean \u2026 um \u2026 ok fine I\u2019m Hank Scorpio.\n",

    "We\u2019d be happy to help.\n",
    "Sure, will aim to do this next week.\n",
    "Agreed, this will be exciting to see!\n",
    "Electric motors also have insane torque. If we load both trucks to the max, electric still wins. Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation.\n",
    "Bring it on https://t.co/pCnln1NdRO.\n",
    "Cybertruck is inspired by games like Halo. Warthog irl!!\n",
    "200k.\n",
    "Yup. Sledgehammer impact on door cracked base of glass, which is why steel ball didn\u2019t bounce off. Should have done steel ball on window, *then* sledgehammer the door. Next time \u2026.\n",
    "Cybertruck pulls F-150 uphill https://t.co/OfaqUkrDI3.\n",
    "Higher hardness, higher strength &amp; doesn\u2019t cost crazy money for ~3mm skins.\n",
    "In general, this is something Tesla should do.\n",
    "We should def make it good to hang out there.\n",
    "Cybertruck is our last product unveil for a while, but there will be some (mostly) unexpected technology announcements next year.\n",
    "Good question. It\u2019s a new variant of 300 series stainless steel, but it also gets cold-worked many times, depending on kilotonnage of press.\n",
    "Can be wrapped in any color!\n",
    "The body panels will actually be laser cut!\n",
    "Long term, it probably makes sense to build a smaller Cybertruck too.\n",
    "Interesting idea.\n",
    "True.\n",
    "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.\n",
    "Really? Ok sure.\n",
    "Hardcore body engineers will understand this at a profound level.\n",
    "Haha true! New manufacturing methods are certainly needed, but then I\u2019m confident it will actually cost less, because of its simplicity &amp; lower part count.\n",
    "\u2694\ufe0f Study the Blade!! \u2694\ufe0f https://t.co/cvuW1TmcjI.\n",
    "We\u2019re creating this alloy at Tesla. Not a problem to create a lot of it, but we\u2019ll need to come up with new body manufacturing methods, as it can\u2019t be made using standard methods.\n",
    "Starship steel decision came first. We were going to use titanium skins for Cybertruck, but cold-rolled 30X stainless is much stronger.\n",
    "Even bending it requires a deep score on inside of bend, which is how the prototype was made.\n",
    "Reason Cybertruck is so planar is that you can\u2019t stamp ultra-hard 30X steel, because it breaks the stamping press.\n",
    "Excellent review by Marques! https://t.co/RaXLl30FfF.\n",
