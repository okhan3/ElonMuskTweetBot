Here are a few notes to get you started:

* Don't touch the \_\_init\_\_.py files. These are necessary to your project.

* Things will be easier if you read the spec first and follow the given function order.

* Make sure you have `pip` installed so you can download pysynth.

* Remember to replace this file with your finished Final Project description.

Good luck on the project!

Our project is a twitter bot that generates Elon Musk-based tweets. 

For general heuristics, we added various grammar rules, ike capitialization and punctuaion.
We also used Spacy to filter which parts of speech can occur at the start and end of each setence.
