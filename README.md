Here are a few notes to get you started:

* Don't touch the \_\_init\_\_.py files. These are necessary to your project.

* Things will be easier if you read the spec first and follow the given function order.

* Make sure you have `pip` installed so you can download pysynth.

* Remember to replace this file with your finished Final Project description.

Good luck on the project!
